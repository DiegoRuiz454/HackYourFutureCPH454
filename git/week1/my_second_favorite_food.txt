Chicken Rice 

is a dish of Chinese origin most commonly associated with Hainanese Cuisine,
Malaysian Cuisine and Singapore Cuisine. It is based on the well-known Hainanese dish called
Wenchang chicken (文昌雞).

Don’t be surprised though, if you find the chicken rice served in Hainan, China is different
from what you can find in Southeast Asia. Over the years, adaption has been made by the
Chinese Hainanese clan who migrated to Southeast Asia which resulted today’s Hainanese
chicken rice in Singapore and Malaysia.
