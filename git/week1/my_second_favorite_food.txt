Chinese rice

1) Use cold rice: You’ve gotta plan ahead and use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice.  A fresh batch of warm (or even lukewarm) rice will not fry well when it hits the hot pan, and will result in soggy and sticky clumps — no good.  So leftover refrigerated rice is ideal!  Or, if you are in a hurry (or have an impulse craving for fried rice,
which I completely understand , just cook up a fresh batch of rice.
Then spread it out on a baking sheet or another large flat pan, drape
the rice with a layer of plastic wrap, then pop it in the fridge for
30 minutes (or in the freezer for 10-15 minutes) until it is thoroughly
chilled (not frozen).

2) Use butter: Yes, butter.  I have made many a batch of fried rice using various
oils, and I’m now convinced there’s a reason why Japanese steak houses use that big
ol’ slab of butter when they’re making fried rice.  It just tastes so much better,
and also makes everything brown up perfectly.  (Although don’t be scared — we only
use 3 tablespoons for a very large batch of rice!)
