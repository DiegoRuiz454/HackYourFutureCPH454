Rice milk

Soak rice in 2 cups (amount as original recipe is written //
adjust if altering batch size) very hot (not boiling water) for 2 hours.
The rice should be soft but still very raw - you should be able to snap 
a piece in half with your fingernail without much effort. Drain and add 
to a high-speed blender.
Add water, salt, and any additional add-ins (optional). Top with lid and
cover with a towel to ensure it doesn't splash. Blend for about 1 minute
until the date specks are very small and the mixture seems well combined.
It doesn't have to be 100% pulverized.

Scoop out a small sample with a spoon to test sweetness. If it's not sweet
enough, add more dates.
Pour the mixture over a large mixing bowl or pitcher covered with a thin towel
or clean T-shirt. In my experience, it benefits from a double strain through
a very fine towel. A nut milk bag lets too much residue through.
Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate. Will keep in the refrigerator
up to 5 days (sometimes more). Great for use in things like smoothies, granola,
vegan cheese sauces, and baked goods!
