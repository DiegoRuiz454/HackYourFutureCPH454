RICE WITH MILK

Home made non dairy yoghurts: I have had some success using a mix of hemp seed (50%),
cashews (10%), flax seeds (30%) and coconut flake (10%) milk. I put all the ingredients
to soak for 12 -24 hours depending on the weather, drain then add fresh water, 
blend and filter through nut bags in batches, heat until almost boiled, then add
the yoghurt starter and use machine or oven light to maintain correct temperature. 
I’m told that adding lecithin can help to stop the milk separating at high temperatures,
but I’ve not experimented with this yet. Xanthan gum, even only the tip of a teaspoon full,
seemed to thicken the mixture to the point of unusable, so no luck there. :) Cheap 
supermarket soya milk is, in my experience,
the easiest to use to turn into yoghurt or ricotta.
